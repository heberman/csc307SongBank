Additionally, if more information on a song or artist is desired, our project has links to the corresponding webpage on Spotify, permitting seemless usage between platforms and giving a user the freedom to explore music to the fullest. Follow this guide for installation tips, a look into the process of making Songbank, or 

<ins>Note:</ins> This project was created using [React](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/).

<h3 align="center">Initial Prototype and Setup</h3>

Click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/gANEf0D6kaiE56LzjMf83T/Music-Bank?node-id=0%3A1) to see our initial design for Songbank. This design gave us a good idea of what we wanted our project to look like once completed. This made the decision process much easier along the way when choosing between different asthetics and visuals.
