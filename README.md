<h1 align="center">Songbank Project</h1>

Description: Our Songbank project is a music service that provides users with a straightforward yet fulfilling experience. Whether one wants to make a playlist with their favorite songs, or choose from a wide array of songs from all over the world, Songbank allows for all of it. Additionally, if more information on a song or artist is desired, our project has links to the corresponding webpage on Spotify, permitting seemless usage between platforms and giving a user the freedom to explore music to the fullest. 

<ins>Note:</ins> This project was created using [React](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/).


<h4 align="center">Initial Prototype and Setup</h4>

Click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/gANEf0D6kaiE56LzjMf83T/Music-Bank?node-id=0%3A1) to see our initial design for Songbank. This design gave us a good idea of what we wanted our project to look like once completed. This made the decision process much easier along the way when choosing between different asthetics and visuals.
