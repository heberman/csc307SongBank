<h1 align="center">Songbank Project</h1>

Description: Our Songbank project is a music service that provides users with a straightforward yet fulfilling experience. Whether one wants to make a playlist with their favorite songs, or choose from a wide array of songs from all over the world, Songbank allows for all of it. Additionally, if more information on a song or artist is desired, our project has links to the corresponding webpage on Spotify, permitting seemless usage between platforms and giving a user the freedom to explore music to the fullest. 

<ins>Note:</ins> This project was created using [React](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/).
